While this code is pretty self-explanatory, yet I would go ahead make it more sensible.\r\n\r\n- #####Initialization of the constructor#####\r\n\tThe paramters are \r\n    1. Screen Width (or any width in terms of number of columns that you want)\r\n    2. The background color (from the list of background colors in the source file)\r\n    3. The foreground color (from the list of background colors in the source file)\r\n    *`tput cols` is a handy command to count the number of columns*\r\n\r\n- #####Clear#####\r\n\tClearing the screen\r\n\r\n- #####Add Message#####\r\n\tAdd a line of text or two. Since, this is a fluid interface, you can chain together multiple methods or the same method multiple times\r\n\r\n- #####Spit (output)#####\r\n\tOutput the final rendition of your masterpiece\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n### Some convinience thrown in\r\n\r\n- #####Colorizer::end()#####\r\n\r\n    This is a static method that terminates the dialogue with a message on screen\r\n\r\n- #####Colorizer::alert()#####\r\n\r\n\tAnother static method that acts as a pop-up, well sort of. It displays your message for 2 seconds and then relinquishes control back to your script\r\n\r\n- #####newLn()#####\r\n\r\n    This is a public function that simply adds a new line to the end of your message\r\n\r\nThere is an `Example.php` file with this project. Do be sure to run it on your terminal and see almost all the features being used in that file.\r\n\r\nAlright then, happy CLI-*fying* everything!",
